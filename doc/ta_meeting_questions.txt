TA meeting
==========

questions
  1. since quantum mechanices in crypto (that is, polarization, filters..) AND key-exechange is already covered in a future lecture, how much of it do we need to re-cover:
    a) in the report?
    b) in the presentation?
  2. Can we demo in the presentation? 
  3. To fill out the report (maybe even presentation?), what background information would be most interesting to focus on.
    We have the following two topics:
      - how do quantum techniques compare to classical ones?
      - What is the current state of quantum computing (how close are we to needing these algorithms / reach quantum supremacy?)
