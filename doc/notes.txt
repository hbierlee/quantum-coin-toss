Alice selects a basis f: either rectilinear <R> (-,|) or diagonal <D> (/,\)
  - analogous to heads/tails
Alice creates n random bits B=b_0..b_n
Alice encodes n qubits Q=q_0..q_n based on each b in B and f
   f   b    q  
  <R>, 0 -> -
  <R>, 1 -> |
  <D>, 0 -> \
  <D>, 1 -> /

Filter      Pauli     Bridge
<R>     ->  PauliZ -> 1

 |  -> |1>
 /  -> |+>
 \  -> |->

Notes
qubit could be implemented as photon
  Each qubit is in superposition
  TODO find out what -, |, / and \ are in qubit notation (and how to set them as such)
  Probably: define measurement of 1 meaning passed through, 0 means blocked. or something


Alice sends photons to Bob
Bob chooses a sequence of  a random filter (either rectilinear / diagonal) for each incoming photon

Say, Alice encoded the bitstring 'rectilinearly'
  Then the photons look like this:
    | | - - | - | - - ...


So for a particular photon i, if Bob happens to use the rectilinear (correct) filter:
  b  q    F
  0  - + <|> ->   0% chance of passing through, write down 0 in Rectilinear table -> correct!
  1  | + <|> -> 100% chance of passing through, write down 1 in Rectilinear table -> correct!

But if he uses the diagonal (incorrect) filter:
  b  q    F
  0  - + <\> ->  50% chance of passing through,
        if blocks, then write down 0 in Diagonal table -> correct! (because if Alice HAD used the diagonal filter, it would have been blocked 100% of the time!)
        if passes, then write down 1 in Diagonal table -> incorrect (as in, the bitstring b_i is actually 0)
  1  | + </> ->  50% chance of passing through,
        if blocks, then write down 0 in Diagonal table -> incorrect!
        if passes, then write down 1 in Diagonal table -> correct!


The bitstring in Bob's Rectilinear table (about n/2 bits) will match with Alice's original bitstring for 100%
The bitstring in Bob's Diagonal table will match with Alice's original bitstring for only 50%, because they were all the result of 45 degree filtering! So this table is random (and random bits match random bits 50% of the time).

Now Bob chooses Rectilinear / Diagonal
Alice reveals her choice (thereby declaring either herself or Bob the winner)
To certify this, she sends Bob the original bitstring, which should match the bits in the 'winning' table (Rectilinear in this case)
(If she tries to cheat, she would have to come up with the sequence that's in Bob's Diagonal table, which is statistically unlikely)
