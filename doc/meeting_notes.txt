1. What problem does the paper address?
- the problem of public key exchange
  - doing this via QM
- the problem of coin-toss
  - doing this via QM
  - how to cheat


2. What solution does the paper propose?
- [TA] do we have to explain polarisation?
  - maybe only one paragraph?
- describe steps of pub_key exchange
- describe steps of coin-toss

3a. What benefits and drawbacks does the solution have? 
- advantage: guarentuee of confidentiality, uncopy-able, passive eavesdropping would be impossible
  - classical: passive eavesdropping can copy your encrypted data (to be broken at a later time, less  future-proof)
- drawbacks: certain things can't be done via QM: attribution (proving to judge), digital signatures
- drawbacks: einstein-podolsky-rosen
- drawback: communication can be disturbedd by noise
- drawback: we don't have quantum channels/computers yet

3b. Are there other approaches to solve the problem?
  - how is this done classically?
    - pub key: diffie helman, double ratchet
    - coin: original paper

- background
  - why do we need quantum equivalents to classically solved problems? Because when we get quantum computer, the classical ways will become insecure
  - report a bit on the state of QC
    - Google approaching quantum supremacy
  - 
- Why do we need to go back to classic communication after exchanging keys in quantum way? What are the drawbacks of staying in quantum communication channel?

- we made a demo
  - [TA] can we use it in the presentation?
- in the report, should we explain the 
  - demo
  - Q#
  - how photons/polarization are represented as qubits ?
